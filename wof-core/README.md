# WoF Core

Kotlin Multiplatform library responsible for providing a motor for the business logic of the apps.

Currently, it supports the following platforms:

- Android
- Desktop (through JVM)
- iOS (X64 and Arm64)

***Note:***
<br>`Until enough test coverage is implemented, a driver application is available to quickly validate the core library on each platform.`
